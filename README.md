## split_expenses web app

is a website i build to practice backend development with laravel at kuraz tech, the project aim is to enable a group of friends who are having fun or sharing their bills to track them properly with out ruining the fun by over analysing the cost of everything, so the website enables a user to create a group then give the group code to his fellow friends, anybody with the code can join, after that each member is able to create expenses for that particular group like dinner,taxi,gamezone payment and extras. also add who ate dinner together who played together for it to be able to eventually calculate who owed who and how much.

## progress

the project is still on progress only the feature group creation, joining groups and adding expenses are enabled.
remaining features are calculating who owes who, who have paid their debts and similar cacluations.
